## Introduction

Kinerra has been in development for a few months, and has gone through many iterations to become the unique Medieval Fantasy MMORPG server that it is today. We still have a grand vision for Kinerra, and we want to be able to finally realize it. We are proud of the progress we have made thus far, yet in order to fully achieve the ambitious plans we have for the game server, we feel it is necessary at this crucial stage in the development process that we work with the Kin Community (many of whom have expressed interest in playing the game) to gather real player feedback based on firsthand experience with the game. Kinerra's Early Access period is the perfect opportunity for us to continue iterating, balancing, and optimizing in order to ensure that the final product is exactly the kind of experience we have hoped to deliver since day one.

## Current State

Kinerra's core gameplay and content is in an advanced playable state, and we're expecting players to really enjoy themselves with the content we have available currently. That being said, we're also expecting to see few bugs, server stability issues, and gameplay balance issues, especially during the beginning stages of closed beta. We'll be relying heavily on player feedback to help us make Kinerra the best experience it can be.

## Registration

The Closed Beta will be available to a limited number of people. The game server will accept no more than **125** concurrent connections. The registration is now open to the public and access will be assigned on a first-come-first-served basis. To register for the Closed Beta, please click [here](https://forms.gle/mBU8VEwuHnCKT3VT6).

## Pass Plus

As we're continuing to improve upon, refine, and expand the game server, we want the development process to be a collaborative effort between us and the Kin Community. As we approach Closed Beta more compute instances are needed, thus an increase in development costs is inevitable. **Pass Plus** is a paid premium-like access to Kinerra's game server, and includes the Founder's Pack which contains several low to mid tier in-game items and bonuses. The price of **Pass Plus** is currently **500,000 Kin**, and once purchased, access and all of its bonuses are carried over to the Open Beta and Liftoff automatically. Please note that you will no longer be able to register for Pass Plus once we start generating enough revenue to cover our costs. As always, thank you for your support. Your contribution is greatly appreciated!
